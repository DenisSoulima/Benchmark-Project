# Benchmark-Project
Hello and welcome!
This application tests the speed of your local machine using threads. After you clone the repo, please run the integer.py and floats.py file and wait 2-5 minutes depending on the type of processor. This benchmark application times your computer's processing speed with 2, 4, 8, and 16 threads, each performed in 3 trials. At the end each program, a graph will be made showing your computer's results.
